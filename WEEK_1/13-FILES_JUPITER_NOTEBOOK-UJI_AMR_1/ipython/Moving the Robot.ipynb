    "It is a so-called [**_differential-drive_** mobile platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_wheeled_robot), with a powered wheel on either side of the robot body, and a rear castor wheel for balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each wheel is powered by its own motor. The motion of the robot is determined by the speed on the wheels:\n",
    "* If both wheels are driven at the same direction and speed, the robot will move in a straight line. \n",
    "* If one speed is higher than the other one, the robot will turn towards the direction of the lower speed. \n",
    "* If both wheels are turned with equal speed in opposite directions, the robot will spin around the central point of its axis.\n",
